            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Tala Temple's origins can be traced back over 1,000 years, rooted in the rich mythological and historical tapestry of Prayagraj.

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The temple derives its name from the “Tala,” which means “bell” in Sanskrit, as a large, ancient bell is said to hang at the entrance of the temple. This bell is believed to have mystical powers, ringing only during auspicious times and signaling the presence of divine energy.

It’s known for its intricately carved stone pillars, expansive courtyards, and well-maintained surroundings.
